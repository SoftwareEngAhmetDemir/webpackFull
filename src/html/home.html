                2 residences with 42 storey and
                1 office block with 36 storey.
                Exceptional living center including
                sports area, social zone, lounge area and
                private kids club all in one complex.
                Consisting of three towers with one for offices and two for residences andgarden offices, Torun Center
                is preparing to bring a new aspect to the area by changing the appearance of Mecidiyeköy with its
                different office alternatives, rich residence life and modern city square.
                Designed by Emre Arolat inspired by the interpretation of “tropism” whichmeans orientation of plants
                towards the sun and located with different positions, the towers display the distinctive panoramic scenes of the
                city reaching out for the Marmara Sea and particularly the Bosphorus with all its facades thanks to this
                design.
